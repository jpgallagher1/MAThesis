We  say that a set $E$ is  {\textit universal} in the collection of dense $G_{\delta}$ 
sets if for all $G_{\delta}$ set,  
we can  always find some affine copies of $E$ inside the set. 
By an affine copy, we  mean sets of  the form $t+\lambda E$ 
for some $t \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\lambda\neq 0$. 
A natural question we have is that  is there a nowhere dense Cantor Set that is universal in the collection of dense $G_\delta$ sets? This is an exploration of an Erd\"{o}s conjecture in a topological setting.

Prove that there is a set of real numbers S of positive measure which does not contain a set E' similar (in the sense of elementary geometry) to E." The proof is known for only a few special cases; and not included among these is the geometric sequence \[\{ {2^{ - n}}\} _{n = 1}^\infty \]. In this paper we examine the known literature, present some new results, and ask a few related questions.},

@article{Kolo,
abstract = {A set A of real numbers is called universal (in measure) if every measurable set of positive measure necessarily contains an affine copy of A. All finite sets are universal, but no infinite universal sets are known. Here we prove some results related to a conjecture of Erdős that there is no infinite universal set. For every infinite set A, there is a set E of positive measure such that (x + tA)⊆E fails for almost all (Lebesgue) pairs (x, t). Also, the exceptional set of pairs (x, t) (for which (x + tA)⊆E) can be taken to project to a null set on the t-axis. Finally, if the set A contains large subsets whose minimum gap is large (in a scale-invariant way), then there is E⊆R of positive measure which contains no affine copy of A. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification 28A12.},

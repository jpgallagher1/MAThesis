\chapter{Introduction}

Here's where you text starts. You might (but don't have to) have sections like\dots

\dots or subsections\dots

\subsection{Introduction to the Introduction to the Introduction}

To include text in your document, you just type. You don't have to worry about spacing between sentences; \LaTeX \ does that automatically. 
To start a new paragraph, just insert an empty line.

Here comes the new paragraph. You can include tables, such as Table \ref{tablename}, which can also be turned if necessary, as seen, e.g. in Table~\ref{tablenameturned}. (I
think the latter is automatically on its own page; the former will just be put where \LaTeX \ thinks it fits best.)

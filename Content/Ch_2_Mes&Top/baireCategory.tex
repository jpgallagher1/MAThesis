\section{Topological and The Baire Category Theorem}
A key theorem that links analysis to set theory is the Baire Category Theorem.  This also establishes a link to understanding certain types of topological sets.  
\begin{theorem}[Baire Category Theorem]%cite munkres
    The countable intersection of open dense sets is dense.  
\end{theorem}

Within the study of measure theory it can sometimes be unclear if a set is dense in another set.  For example consider the following set: 
$$\R^2 \setminus \{(x,y): y=mx + b, \text{where $m, b \in \Q$.}\}$$
Notice that this can also be written as $$\bigcap_{m,b \in \Q} \R^2 \setminus \{(x,y): y=mx+b\}, $$ which is the plane, but removing all lines with rational coefficients, and rational intercepts.

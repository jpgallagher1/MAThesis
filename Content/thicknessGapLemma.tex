\section{The Gap Lemma}
\begin{lemma}{The Gap Lemma}\cite{palis&takens}
    Let $K_1, K_2, \subset \R$ be cCantor sets with thickness $\tau_1$ and  $\tau_2$.  If $\tau_1 \cdot \tau_2 >1,$ then one of the following three alternatives occurs: $K_1$ is contained the gap of $K_2$; $K_2$ is contained in the gap of $K_1$; $K_1 \cap K_2 \neq \emptyset.$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Let $K_1, K_2$ be two Cantor sets with thickness $\tau_1, \tau_2$ respectively and assume that $K_1$ is not contained in the gap of $K_2$ and $K_2$ is not contained in the gap of $K_1$.  

    For the sake of contradiction, assume that $K_1 \cap K_2 = \emptyset$.  By assumption we know that $K_1, K_2$ are not contained in the other's gaps.  Consider the gaps $U_1 \subset K_1^c$ and $U_2 \subset K_2^c$.  We call $(U_1, U_2)$ a gap-pair if $U_1$ contains exactly one boundary point of $U_2$ and $U_2$ contains exactly one point of $U_1$.  
\end{proof}
